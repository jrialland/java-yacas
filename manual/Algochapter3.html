3. A simple factorization algorithm for univariate polynomials
</h1>
<p> </p>
This section discusses factoring polynomials using
arithmetic modulo prime numbers. Information was
used from D. Knuth, <i>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2, Seminumerical Algorithms </i>
and J.H. Davenport et. al., <i>Computer Algebra, SYSTEMS AND ALGORITHMS FOR ALGEBRAIC COMPUTATION</i>.


<p>
A simple factorization algorithm is developed
for univariate polynomials. This algorithm is implemented
as the function <b><tt>BinaryFactors</tt></b>. The algorithm was named
the binary factoring algorithm since it determines 
factors to a polynomial modulo $2 ^{n}$ for successive 
values of $n$, effectively adding one binary digit to
the solution in each iteration. No reference to this
algorithm has been found so far in literature.


<p>
Berlekamp showed that polynomials can be efficiently factored
when arithmetic is done modulo a prime. The Berlekamp
algorithm is only efficient for small primes, but after that
Hensel lifting can be used to determine the factors modulo
larger numbers.


<p>
The algorithm presented here is similar in approach to applying
the Berlekamp algorithm to factor modulo a small prime, and then
factoring modulo powers of this prime (using the solutions found modulo
the small prime by the Berlekamp algorithm) by applying Hensel lifting.
However it is simpler in set up. It factors modulo 2, by trying
all possible factors modulo 2 (two possibilities, if the polynomial
is monic). This performs the same action usually left to the 
Berlekamp step. After that, given a solution modulo $2 ^{n}$, it will
test for a solution $f_i$ modulo $2 ^{n}$ if $f_i$ or $f_i + 2 ^{n}$ 
are a solution modulo $2 ^{n + 1}$.


<p>
This scheme raises the precision of the solution with one 
digit in binary representation. This is similar to the linear
Hensel lifting algorithm, which factors modulo $p ^{n}$ for some prime $p$, where
$n$ increases by one after each iteration. There is also a 
quadratic version of Hensel lifting which factors modulo $p ^{2 ^{n}}$,
in effect doubling the number of digits (in p-adic expansion) of the solution after
each iteration. However, according to "Davenport", the quadratic
algorithm is not necessarily faster.


<p>
The algorithm here thus should be equivalent in complexity
to Hensel lifting linear version. This has not been verified yet.

<h2>
<hr>3.1 Modular arithmetic
</h2>
This section copies some definitions and rules from
<i>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1, Fundamental Algorithms </i>
regarding arithmetic modulo an integer.


<p>
Arithmetic modulo an integer $p$  requires performing the
arithmetic operation and afterwards determining that
integer modulo $p$. A number $x$ can be written as 
$$x = q p + r$$
where $q$ is called the quotient, and $r$ remainder.
There is some liberty in the range one chooses $r$
to be in. If $r$ is an integer in the range $<b><tt>0,1, ... ,(p-1)</tt></b>$
then it is the <i>modulo</i>, $r = x\bmod p$.


<p>
When $x\bmod p = y\bmod p$, the notation $\left( x = y\right) \bmod p$
is used. All arithmetic calculations are done modulo
an integer $p$ in that case.


<p>
For calculations modulo some $p$ the following rules
hold:


<p>
<ul><li>If </li>$\left( a = b\right) \bmod p$ and $\left( x = y\right) \bmod p$, then
$\left( a x = b y\right) \bmod p$, $\left( a + x = b + y\right) \bmod p$, and $\left( a - x = b - y\right) \bmod p$.
This means that for instance also $x ^{n}\bmod p = \left( x\bmod p\right)  ^{n}\bmod p$
</ul>

<p>
<ul><li>Two numbers </li>$x$ and $y$ are <i>relatively prime</i> if they don't 
share a common factor, that is, if their greatest common denominator 
is one, $\mathrm{ Gcd }\left( x, y\right)  = 1$.
</ul>

<p>
<ul><li>If </li>$\left( a x = b y\right) \bmod p$ and if $\left( a = b\right) \bmod p$, and if $a$ and
$p$ are relatively prime, then $\left( x = y\right) \bmod p$.
This is useful for dividing out common factors.
</ul>

<p>
<ul><li></li>$\left( a = b\right) \bmod p$ if and only if $\left( a n = b n\right) \bmod \left( n p\right) $ when $n\neq 0$.
Also, if $r$ and $s$ are relatively prime, then $\left( a = b\right) \bmod \left( r s\right) $ only if
$\left( a = b\right) \bmod r$ and $\left( a = b\right) \bmod s$.
These rules are useful when the modulus is changed.
</ul>

<p>
For polynomials $v_1\left( x\right) $ and $v_2\left( x\right) $ it further holds
that 
$$\left( \left( v_1\left( x\right)  + v_2\left( x\right) \right)  ^{p} = v_1\left( x\right)  ^{p} + v_2\left( x\right)  ^{p}\right) \bmod p$$
This follows by writing out the expression, noting that
the binomial coefficients that result are multiples of $p$,
and thus their value modulo $p$ is zero ($p$ divides these
coefficients), so only the two terms on the right hand side 
remain.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Some corollaries
</h3>
One corollary of the rules for calculations modulo an integer
is <i>Fermat's theorem, 1640</i> : if $p$ is a prime number
then 
$$\left( a ^{p} = a\right) \bmod p$$
for all integers $a$ (for a proof, see Knuth).


<p>
An interesting corollary to this is that, for some 
prime integer $p$:
$$\left( v\left( x\right)  ^{p} = v\left( x ^{p}\right) \right) \bmod p.$$
This follows from writing it out and using Fermat's theorem
to replace $a ^{p}$ with $a$ where appropriate (the coefficients
to the polynomial when written out, on the left hand side).

<h2>
<hr>3.2 Factoring using modular arithmetic
</h2>
The task is to factor a polynomial 


<p>
$$p\left( x\right)  = a_n x ^{n} + \mathrm{ ... } + a_0$$


<p>
into a form 


<p>
$$p\left( x\right)  = C g\left( x\right)  f_1\left( x\right)  ^{p_1} f_2\left( x\right)  ^{p_2} \mathrm{ ... } f_m\left( x\right)  ^{p_m}$$


<p>
Where $f_i\left( x\right) $ are irreducible polynomials of the form:


<p>
$$f_i\left( x\right)  = x + c_i$$


<p>
The part that could not be factorized is returned as $g\left( x\right) $,
with a possible constant factor $C$.


<p>
The factors $f_i\left( x\right) $ and $g\left( x\right) $ are determined uniquely by requiring
them to be monic. The constant $C$ accounts for a common factor.


<p>
The $c_i$ constants in the resulting solutions $f_i\left( x\right) $ can be 
rational numbers (or even complex numbers, if Gaussian integers
are used).


<p>

<a name="c3s3">

</a>
<h2>
<hr>3.3 Preparing the polynomial for factorization
</h2>
The final factoring algorithm needs the input polynomial to
be monic with integer coefficients (a polynomial is monic if
its leading coefficient is one). Given a non-monic 
polynomial with rational coefficients, the following steps
are performed:


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Convert polynomial with rational coefficients to polynomial with integer coefficients
</h3>
First the least common multiple $\mathrm{ lcm }$ of the denominators of the
coefficients $p\left( x\right) $ has to be found, and the polynomial is multiplied by this number. 
Afterwards, the $C$ constant in the result should have a factor
$\frac{1}{\mathrm{ lcm }} $.


<p>
The polynomial now only has integer coefficients.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Convert polynomial to a monic polynomial
</h3>
The next step is to convert the polynomial to one where the leading
coefficient is one. In order to do so, following "Davenport",
the following steps have to be taken:


<p>
<ul><li>Multiply the polynomial by </li>$a_n ^{n - 1}$
<li>Perform the substitution </li>$x = \frac{y}{a_n} $
</ul>

<p>
The polynomial is now a monic polynomial in $y$.


<p>
After factoring, the irreducible factors of $p\left( x\right) $
can be obtained by multiplying $C$ with $\frac{1}{a_n ^{n - 1}} $,
and replacing $y$ with $a_n x$. The irreducible 
solutions $a_n x + c_i$ can be replaced by $x + \frac{c_i}{a_i} $
after multiplying $C$ by $a_n$, converting the factors
to monic factors.


<p>
After the steps described here the polynomial is now monic with integer coefficients,
and the factorization of this polynomial can be used to 
determine the factors of the original polynomial $p\left( x\right) $.

<h2>
<hr>3.4 Definition of division of polynomials
</h2>
To factor a polynomial a division operation for polynomials
modulo some integer is needed. This algorithm needs to return
a quotient $q\left( x\right) $ and remainder $r\left( x\right) $ such that:


<p>
$$\left( p\left( x\right)  = q\left( r\right)  d\left( x\right)  + r\left( x\right) \right) \bmod p$$


<p>
for some polymomial $d\left( x\right) $ to be divided by, modulo 
some integer p. $d\left( x\right) $ is
said to divide $p\left( x\right) $ (modulo $p$) if $r\left( x\right) $ is zero.
It is then a factor modulo $p$.


<p>
For binary factoring algorithm it is important
that if some monic $d\left( x\right) $ divides $p\left( x\right) $, then it also
divides $p\left( x\right) $ modulo some integer $p$.


<p>
Define $\mathrm{ deg }\left( f\left( x\right) \right) $ to be the degree of $f\left( x\right) $ and $lc\left( f\left( x\right) \right) $
to be the leading coefficient of $f\left( x\right) $. Then, if 
$\mathrm{ deg }\left( p\left( x\right) \right) \geq \mathrm{ deg }\left( d\left( x\right) \right) $, one can compute an integer $s$
such that


<p>
$$\left( lc\left( d\left( x\right) \right)  s = lc\left( p\left( x\right) \right) \right) \bmod p$$


<p>
If $p$ is prime, then 


<p>
$$s = \left( lc\left( p\left( x\right) \right)  lc\left( d\left( x\right) \right)  ^{p - 2}\right) \bmod p$$


<p>
Because $\left( a ^{p - 1} = 1\right) \bmod p$ for any $a$. If $p$ is not prime
but $d\left( x\right) $ is monic (and thus $lc\left( d\left( x\right) \right)  = 1$),


<p>
$$s = lc\left( p\left( x\right) \right) $$


<p>
This identity can also be used when dividing in 
general (not modulo some integer), since the 
divisor is monic.


<p>
The quotient can then be updated by adding 
a term:


<p>
$\mathrm{ term } = s x ^{\mathrm{ deg }\left( p\left( x\right) \right)  - \mathrm{ deg }\left( d\left( x\right) \right) }$


<p>
and updating the polynomial to be divided, $p\left( x\right) $,
by subtracting $d\left( x\right)  \mathrm{ term }$. The resulting polynomial
to be divided now has a degree one smaller than the
previous.


<p>
When the degree of $p\left( x\right) $ is less than the degree
of $d\left( x\right) $ it is returned as the remainder.


<p>
A full division algorithm for arbitrary integer $p &gt; 1$
with $lc\left( d\left( x\right) \right)  = 1$ would thus look like:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
divide(p(x),d(x),p)
   q(x) = 0
   r(x) = p(x)
   while (deg(r(x)) &gt;= deg(d(x)))
      s = lc(r(x))
      term = s*x^(deg(r(x))-deg(d(x)))
      q(x) = q(x) + term
      r(x) = r(x) - term*d(x) mod p
   return {q(x),r(x)}
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
The reason we can get away with factoring modulo $2 ^{n}$
as opposed to factoring modulo some prime $p$ in later
sections is that the divisor $d\left( x\right) $ is monic. Its leading 
coefficient is one and thus $q\left( x\right) $ and $r\left( x\right) $ can be 
uniquely determined. If $p$ is not prime and $lc\left( d\left( x\right) \right) $
is not equal to one, there might be multiple combinations
for which $p\left( x\right)  = q\left( x\right)  d\left( x\right)  + r\left( x\right) $, and we are interested
in the combinations where $r\left( x\right) $ is zero. This can be
costly to determine unless <b><tt>q(x),r(x)</tt></b> is unique.
This is the case here because we are factoring
a monic polynomial, and are thus only interested in cases
where $lc\left( d\left( x\right) \right)  = 1$.

<h2>
<hr>3.5 Determining possible factors modulo 2
</h2>
We start with a polynomial $p\left( x\right) $ which is monic and
has integer coefficients.


<p>
It will be factored into a form:


<p>
$$p\left( x\right)  = g\left( x\right)  f_1\left( x\right)  ^{p_1} f_2\left( x\right)  ^{p_2} \mathrm{ ... } f_m\left( x\right)  ^{p_m}$$


<p>
where all factors $f_i\left( x\right) $ are monic also.


<p>
The algorithm starts by setting up a test polynomial,
$p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) $ which divides $p\left( x\right) $, but has the property
that


<p>
$$p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right)  = g\left( x\right)  f_1\left( x\right)  f_2\left( x\right)  \mathrm{ ... } f_m\left( x\right) $$


<p>
Such a polynomial is said to be <i>square-free</i>. 
It has the same factors as the original polynomial, but
the original might have multiple of each factor, 
where $p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) $ does not.


<p>
The square-free part of a polynomial can be obtained
as follows:


<p>
$$p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right)  = \frac{p\left( x\right) }{\mathrm{ Gcd }\left( p\left( x\right) , \frac{d}{d x}p\left( x\right) \right) } $$


<p>
It can be seen by simply writing this out that 
$p\left( x\right) $ and $\frac{d}{d x}p\left( x\right) $ will have factors $f_i\left( x\right)  ^{p_i - 1}$ in 
common. these can thus be divided out.


<p>
It is not a requirement of the algorithm that the
algorithm being worked with is square-free, but it
speeds up computations to work with the square-free
part of the polynomial if the only thing sought after
is the set of factors. The multiplicity of the factors
can be determined using the original $p\left( x\right) $.


<p>
Binary factoring then proceeds by trying to find potential solutions
modulo $p = 2$ first. There can only be two such
solutions: $x + 0$ and $x + 1$. 


<p>
A list of possible solutions $L$ is set up with potential solutions.


<p>

<a name="c3s6">

</a>
<h2>
<hr>3.6 Determining factors modulo $2 ^{n}$ given a factorization modulo 2
</h2>
At this point there is a list $L$ with solutions modulo
$2 ^{n}$ for some $n$. The solutions will be of the form:
$x + a$. The first step is to determine if any of the
elements in $L$ divides $p\left( x\right) $ (not modulo any integer).
Since $x + a$ divides $p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) $ modulo $2 ^{n}$, 
both $x + a$ and $x + a - 2 ^{n}$ have to be checked.


<p>
If an element in $L$ divides $p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) $, $p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) $
is divided by it, and a loop is entered to test how often
it divides $p\left( x\right) $ to determine the multiplicity $p_i$ of the
factor. The found factor $f_i\left( x\right)  = x + c_i$ is added 
as a combination ($x + c_i$, $p_i$). $p\left( x\right) $ is divided by $f_i\left( x\right)  ^{p_i}$.


<p>
At this point there is a list $L$ of factors that divide
$p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) $ modulo $2 ^{n}$. This implies that for each
of the elements $u$ in $L$, either $u$ or $u + 2 ^{n}$ should
divide $p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) $ modulo $2 ^{n + 1}$.
The following step is thus to set up a new list with new
elements that divide $p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) $ modulo $2 ^{n + 1}$.


<p>
The loop is re-entered, this time doing the calculation
modulo $2 ^{n + 1}$ instead of modulo $2 ^{n}$.


<p>
The loop is terminated if the number of factors found
equals $\mathrm{ deg }\left( p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) \right) $, or if $2 ^{n}$ is larger than
the smallest non-zero coefficient of $p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) $ as this 
smallest non-zero coefficient is the product of all the 
smallest non-zero coefficients of the factors, or if 
the list of potential factors is zero.


<p>
The polynomial $p\left( x\right) $ can not be factored any further,
and is added as a factor ($p\left( x\right) $, $1$).


<p>
The function <b><tt>BinaryFactors</tt></b>, when implemented, yields
the following interaction in Yacas:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; BinaryFactors((x+1)^4*(x-3)^2)
Out&gt; {{x-3,2},{x+1,4}}
In&gt; BinaryFactors((x-1/5)*(2*x+1/3))
Out&gt; {{2,1},{x-1/5,1},{x+1/6,1}}
In&gt; BinaryFactors((x-1123125)*(2*x+123233))
Out&gt; {{2,1},{x-1123125,1},{x+123233/2,1}}
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
The binary factoring algorithm starts with a factorization modulo 2,
and then each time tries to guess the next bit of the 
solution, maintaining a list of potential solutions.
This list can grow exponentially in certain instances.
For instance, factoring $\left( x - a\right)  \left( x - 2 a\right)  \left( x - 3 a\right)  \mathrm{ ... }$
implies a that the roots have common factors. There
are inputs where the number
of potential solutions (almost) doubles with each iteration. 
For these inputs the algorithm becomes exponential. The worst-case
performance is therefore exponential. The list of potential
solutions while iterating will contain a lot of false roots
in that case.

<h2>
<hr>3.7 Efficiently deciding if a polynomial divides another
</h2>
Given the polynomial $p\left( x\right) $, and a potential divisor 
$$f_i\left( x\right)  = x - p$$ modulo some $q = 2 ^{n}$ an expression for
the remainder after division is


<p>
$$\mathrm{ rem }\left( p\right)  = \sum _{i = 0} ^{n} a_i p ^{i}$$


<p>
For the initial solutions modulo 2, where the possible 
solutions are $x$ and $x - 1$. For $p = 0$, $\mathrm{ rem }\left( 0\right)  = a_0$.
For $p = 1$, $\mathrm{ rem }\left( 1\right)  = \sum _{i = 0} ^{n} a_i$ .


<p>
Given a solution $x - p$ modulo $q = 2 ^{n}$, we consider
the possible solutions $\left( x - p\right) \bmod 2 ^{n + 1}$ and 
$\left( x - \left( p + 2 ^{n}\right) \right) \bmod \left( 2 ^{n} + 1\right) $.


<p>
$x - p$ is a possible solution if $\mathrm{ rem }\left( p\right) \bmod 2 ^{n + 1} = 0$.


<p>
$x - \left( p + q\right) $ is a possible solution if $\mathrm{ rem }\left( p + q\right) \bmod 2 ^{n + 1} = 0$.
Expanding $\mathrm{ rem }\left( p + q\right) \bmod \left( 2 q\right) $ yields:


<p>
$$\mathrm{ rem }\left( p + q\right) \bmod \left( 2 q\right)  = \left( \mathrm{ rem }\left( p\right)  + \mathrm{ extra }\left( p, q\right) \right) \bmod \left( 2 q\right) $$


<p>
When expanding this expression, some terms
grouped under $\mathrm{ extra }\left( p, q\right) $ have factors like $2 q$ 
or $q ^{2}$. Since $q = 2 ^{n}$, these terms vanish if the
calculation is done modulo $2 ^{n + 1}$.


<p>
The expression for $\mathrm{ extra }\left( p, q\right) $ then becomes 
$$\mathrm{ extra }\left( p, q\right)  = q \sum _{i = 1} ^{\frac{n}{2} } \left( 2 i - 1\right)  a\left( 2 i\right)  p ^{2 i - 2}$$


<p>
An efficient approach to determining if $x - p$ or $x - \left( p + q\right) $
divides $p\left( x\right) $ modulo $2 ^{n + 1}$ is then to first calculate
$\mathrm{ rem }\left( p\right) \bmod \left( 2 q\right) $. If this is zero, $x - p$ divides $p\left( x\right) $.
In addition, if $\left( \mathrm{ rem }\left( p\right)  + \mathrm{ extra }\left( p, q\right) \right) \bmod \left( 2 q\right) $ is zero, 
$x - \left( p + q\right) $ is a potential candidate.


<p>
Other efficiencies are derived from the fact that the operations
are done in binary. Eg. if $q = 2 ^{n}$, then $q_\mathrm{ next } = 2 ^{n + 1} = 2 q = q&lt;&lt;1$ is 
used in the next iteration. Also, calculations modulo $2 ^{n}$
are equivalent to performing a bitwise and with $2 ^{n} - 1$. These
operations can in general be performed efficiently on 
todays hardware which is based on binary representations.

<h2>
<hr>3.8 Extending the algorithm
</h2>
Only univariate polynomials with rational coefficients
have been considered so far. This could be extended to
allow for roots that are complex numbers $a + \imath  b$ where 
both $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers.


<p>
For this to work the division algorithm would have to 
be extended to handle complex numbers with integer
$a$ and $b$ modulo some integer, and the initial
setup of the potential solutions would have to be
extended to try $x + 1 + \imath $ and $x + \imath $ also. The step where
new potential solutions modulo $2 ^{n + 1}$ are determined
should then also test for $x + \imath \cdot 2 ^{n}$ and $x + 2 ^{n} + \imath \cdot 2 ^{n}$.


<p>
The same extension could be made for multivariate polynomials,
although setting up the initial irreducible polynomials
that divide $p_\mathrm{ test }\left( x\right) $ modulo 2 might become expensive
if done on a polynomial with many variables ($2 ^{2 ^{m} - 1}$ trials
for $m$ variables).


<p>
Lastly, polynomials with real-valued coefficients <i>could</i>
be factored, if the coefficients were first converted to
rational numbers. However, for real-valued coefficients
there exist other methods (Sturm sequences).

<h2>
<hr>3.9 Newton iteration
</h2>
What the <b><tt>BinaryFactor</tt></b> algorithm effectively does is 
finding a set of potential solutions modulo $2 ^{n + 1}$ when
given a set of potential solutions modulo $2 ^{n}$.
There is a better algorithm that does something similar:
Hensel lifting. Hensel lifting is a generalized form of
Newton iteration, where given a factorization modulo 
$p$, each iteration returns a factorization modulo $p ^{2}$.


<p>
Newton iteration is based on the following idea: when one
takes a Taylor series expansion of a function:


<p>
$$f\left( x _{0} + dx\right) \equiv f\left( x _{0}\right)  + \left( \frac{d}{d x}f\left( x _{0}\right) \right)  dx + \mathrm{ ... }$$


<p>
Newton iteration then proceeds by taking only the first
two terms in this series, the constant plus the constant
times $dx$. Given some good initial value $x_0$, the function
will is assumed to be close to a root, and the function 
is assumed to be almost linear, hence this approximation.
Under these assumptions, if we want $f\left( x_0 + dx\right) $ to be zero,


<p>
$$f\left( x _{0} + dx\right)  = f\left( x _{0}\right)  + \left( \frac{d}{d x}f\left( x _{0}\right) \right)  dx = 0$$


<p>
This yields:


<p>
$$dx\equiv  - \frac{f\left( x _{0}\right) }{\frac{d}{d x}f\left( x _{0}\right) }  = 0$$


<p>
And thus a next, better, approximation for the root is
$x _{1}\equiv x_0 - \frac{f\left( x _{0}\right) }{\frac{d}{d x}f\left( x _{0}\right) } $, or more general:


<p>
$$x _{n + 1} = x _{n} - \frac{f\left( x _{n}\right) }{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f\left( x _{n}\right) } $$


<p>
If the root has multiplicity one, a Newton iteration can
converge <i>quadratically</i>, meaning the number of 
decimals precision for each iteration doubles.


<p>
As an example, we can try to find a root of $\sin x$ near
$3$, which should converge to $\pi $.

</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
We first set up a function $dx\left( x\right) $:
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; dx(x):=Eval(-Sin(x)/(D(x)Sin(x)))
Out&gt; True;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
And we start with a good initial approximation to $\pi $,
namely $3$. Note we should set <b><tt>x</tt></b> <i>after</i> we set
dx(x), as the right hand side of the function definition is
evaluated. We could also have used a different parameter name
for the definition of the function $dx\left( x\right) $.


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; x:=3
Out&gt; 3;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
We can now start the iteration:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; x:=N(x+dx(x))
Out&gt; 3.142546543074277805295635410534;
In&gt; x:=N(x+dx(x))
Out&gt; 3.14159265330047681544988577172;
In&gt; x:=N(x+dx(x))
Out&gt; 3.141592653589793238462643383287;
In&gt; x:=N(x+dx(x))
Out&gt; 3.14159265358979323846264338328;
In&gt; x:=N(x+dx(x))
Out&gt; 3.14159265358979323846264338328;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
As shown, in this example the iteration converges quite
quickly.

<h3>
<hr>Finding roots of multiple equations in multiple variables using Newton iteration
</h3>
One generalization, mentioned in W.H. Press et al., 
<i>NUMERICAL RECIPES in C, The Art of Scientific computing</i>
is finding roots for multiple functions in multiple variables.


<p>
Given $N$ functions in $N$ variables, we want to solve


<p>
$$f_i\left( x _{1}, \mathrm{ ... }, x _{N}\right)  = 0$$


<p>
for $i = 1..N$. If de denote by $\mathrm{X}$ the vector 
$$ X := <b><tt>x[1],x[2],...,x[N]</tt></b> $$


<p>
and by $dX$ the delta vector, then one can write


<p>
$$f_i\left( \mathrm{X} + dX\right) \equiv f_i\left( \mathrm{X}\right)  + \sum _{j = 1} ^{N} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}f_i\left( \mathrm{X}\right) \right)  dx _{j}$$


<p>
Setting $f_i\left( \mathrm{X} + dX\right) $ to zero, one obtains


<p>
$$\sum _{j = 1} ^{N} a _{\left( i, j\right) } dx_j = b _{i}$$


<p>
where


<p>
$$a _{\left( i, j\right) }\equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}f_i\left( \mathrm{X}\right) $$


<p>
and


<p>
$$b_i\equiv  - f_i\left( \mathrm{X}\right) $$


<p>
So the generalization is to first initialize $\mathrm{X}$ to a good
initial value, calculate the matrix elements $a _{\left( i, j\right) }$ and
the vector $b _{i}$, and then to proceed to calculate $dX$
by solving the matrix equation, and calculating 


<p>
$$\mathrm{X} _{i + 1}\equiv \mathrm{X} _{i} + dX _{i}$$


<p>
In the case of one function with one variable, the summation
reduces to one term, so this linear set of equations was
a lot simpler in that case. In this case we will have to solve
this set of linear equations in each iteration.


<p>
As an example, suppose we want to find the zeroes for the
following two functions:


<p>
$$f_1\left( a, x\right) \equiv \sin a x$$


<p>
and


<p>
$$f_2\left( a, x\right) \equiv a - 2$$


<p>
It is clear that the solution to this is $a = 2$ and $x\equiv N \frac{\pi }{2} $
for any integer value $N$.


<p>
We will do calculations with precision 30:
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; Builtin'Precision'Set(30)
Out&gt; True;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
And set up a vector of functions $<b><tt>f_1(X),f_2(X)</tt></b>$
where $X:=<b><tt>a,x</tt></b>$
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; f(a,x):={Sin(a*x),a-2}
Out&gt; True;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
Now we set up a function <b><tt>matrix(a,x)</tt></b> which returns the
matrix $a _{\left( i, j\right) }$:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; matrix(a,x):=Eval({D(a)f(a,x),D(x)f(a,x)})
Out&gt; True;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
We now set up some initial values:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; {a,x}:={1.5,1.5}
Out&gt; {1.5,1.5};
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
The iteration converges a lot slower for this example, so we
will loop 100 times:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; For(ii:=1,ii&lt;100,ii++)[{a,x}:={a,x}+\
   N(SolveMatrix(matrix(a,x),-f(a,x)));]
Out&gt; True;
In&gt; {a,x}
Out&gt; {2.,0.059667311457823162437151576236};
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
The value for $a$ has already been found. Iterating a
few more times:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; For(ii:=1,ii&lt;100,ii++)[{a,x}:={a,x}+\
   N(SolveMatrix(matrix(a,x),-f(a,x)));]
Out&gt; True;
In&gt; {a,x}
Out&gt; {2.,-0.042792753588155918852832259721};
In&gt; For(ii:=1,ii&lt;100,ii++)[{a,x}:={a,x}+\
   N(SolveMatrix(matrix(a,x),-f(a,x)));]
Out&gt; True;
In&gt; {a,x}
Out&gt; {2.,0.035119151349413516969586788023};
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
the value for $x$ converges a lot slower this time, and to the uninteresting
value of zero (a rather trivial zero of this set of functions).
In fact for all integer values $N$ the value $N \frac{\pi }{2} $ is a solution.
Trying various initial values will find them.

<h3>
<hr>Newton iteration on polynomials
</h3>
von zur Gathen et al., <i>Modern Computer algebra</i> discusses
taking the inverse of a polynomial using Newton iteration.
The task is, given a polynomial $f\left( x\right) $, to find a polynomial
$g\left( x\right) $ such that $f\left( x\right)  = \frac{1}{g\left( x\right) } $, modulo some power in x.
This implies that we want to find a polynom $g$ for which:


<p>
$$h\left( g\right)  = \frac{1}{g}  - f = 0$$


<p>
Applying a Newton iteration step $g _{i + 1} = g _{i} - \frac{h\left( g _{i}\right) }{\frac{\partial}{\partial g}h\left( g _{i}\right) } $
to this expression yields:


<p>
$$g _{i + 1} = 2 g _{i} - f g _{i} ^{2}$$


<p>
von zur Gathen then proves by induction that for $f\left( x\right) $ monic,
and thus $f\left( 0\right)  = 1$, given initial value $g_0\left( x\right)  = 1$, that


<p>
$$\left( f g_i = 1\right) \bmod x ^{2 ^{i}}$$


<p>
Example:


<p>
suppose we want to find the polynomial $g\left( x\right) $ up to the 7th degree
for which $\left( f\left( x\right)  g\left( x\right)  = 1\right) \bmod x ^{8}$, for the function


<p>
$$f\left( x\right) \equiv 1 + x + \frac{x ^{2}}{2}  + \frac{x ^{3}}{6}  + \frac{x ^{4}}{24} $$


<p>
First we define the function f:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; f:=1+x+x^2/2+x^3/6+x^4/24
Out&gt; x+x^2/2+x^3/6+x^4/24+1;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
And initialize $g$ and $i$.


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; g:=1
Out&gt; 1;
In&gt; i:=0
Out&gt; 0;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
Now we iterate, increasing $i$, and replacing $g$ with the
new value for $g$:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; [i++;g:=BigOh(2*g-f*g^2,x,2^i);]
Out&gt; 1-x;
In&gt; [i++;g:=BigOh(2*g-f*g^2,x,2^i);]
Out&gt; x^2/2-x^3/6-x+1;
In&gt; [i++;g:=BigOh(2*g-f*g^2,x,2^i);]
Out&gt; x^7/72-x^6/72+x^4/24-x^3/6+x^2/2-x+1;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
The resulting expression must thus be:


<p>
$$g\left( x\right) \equiv \frac{x ^{7}}{72}  - \frac{x ^{6}}{72}  + \frac{x ^{4}}{24}  - \frac{x ^{3}}{6}  + \frac{x ^{2}}{2}  - x + 1$$


<p>
We can easily verify this:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; Expand(f*g)
Out&gt; x^11/1728+x^10/576+x^9/216+(5*x^8)/576+1;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
This expression is 1 modulo $x ^{8}$, as can easily be shown:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; BigOh(%,x,8)
Out&gt; 1;
</pre></tr>
</table>
